John went for a bike ride. He rode around the block. Then he met some girls he knew from school. 
They all rode to the field to play. John had a great time play–ing games with his friends. Lisa 
went to a birth–day par–ty on Sat–ur–day. There were many girls there. They played a lot of great 
games at the par–ty. Then they had dessert. All of the girls got bal–loons as par–ty fa–vors. Lisa l
oved her red bal–loon. Tim went to the park with his broth–er. They brought base–balls and gloves. 
They played catch for two hours. It start–ed to get very hot out, so they went home for some lemon–ade. 
They had a great day. Mary and her fam–i–ly went sled–ding. They each brought their own sled. When 
they got to the hill, they had a race. Mary’s broth–er won the race, and she was hap–py for him. 
Af–ter a long, fun day of sled–ding, Mary and her fam–i–ly went home and had hot choco–late. We 
have a soc–cer game this morn–ing. We are play–ing against a team from an–oth–er school. I get 
to play strik–er. I like scor–ing goals. At half–time no one has scored yet. We get to eat or–ange 
slices dur–ing the break. In the sec–ond half I score a goal. We win the match. We are mak–ing a 
piz–za. First we make the dough with flour and eggs. We flat–ten the dough in–to a round shape. 
Then we put toma–to sauce and cheese on top. The piz–za goes in–to the oven. In a few min–utes, 
it is ready to eat. I have a dog, a cat and a ham–ster. I love them all. My dog’s name is Snoopy; 
my cat’s name is Whiskers, and my ham–ster’s name is Nib–bles. Snoopy is play–ful, and he likes 
bones. Whiskers sleeps in my bed. Nib–bles loves run–ning in his wheel. They are all soft and 
fur–ry The ocean has bright blue wa–ter filled with waves. Many types of fish live in the ocean.
